# Face-Detection-Recognizing-Identifying-and-Classifying-Faces

Project Description:In this project, my goal is to build a Face Mask Segmentation model which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image.
Dataset:WIDER Face Dataset
WIDER FACE dataset is a Face Mask Segmentation benchmark dataset, of which images are selected from the publicly available WIDER dataset. 
This data have 32,203 images and 393,703 faces are labeled with a high degree of variability in scale, pose and occlusion as depicted in the sample images.

Objective:In this problem, I am using "Transfer Learning" of an Image Segmentation model to detect any object according to the problem in hand.
